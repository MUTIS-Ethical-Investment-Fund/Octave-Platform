The regression function `run_regression(merged_df)` in this code is running a multiple linear regression using the Fama-French three-factor model. This model is widely used in finance to evaluate the performance of a stock or a portfolio by explaining the excess returns it generates over the risk-free rate.

The Fama-French three-factor model is an extension of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and incorporates three factors:

1.  Market Risk Premium (Mkt-RF): This factor represents the excess return of the overall market portfolio over the risk-free rate. A higher Mkt-RF value means the overall market is performing better relative to the risk-free rate. In the regression, this factor is represented by the `Beta_Mkt` coefficient, which measures the sensitivity of the stock's returns to the market returns.
    
2.  Size Factor (SMB, Small Minus Big): This factor represents the difference in returns between small-cap and large-cap stocks. A positive SMB value implies that small-cap stocks have outperformed large-cap stocks. In the regression, this factor is represented by the `Beta_SMB` coefficient, which measures the stock's exposure to the size factor.
    
3.  Value Factor (HML, High Minus Low): This factor represents the difference in returns between value stocks (with high book-to-market ratios) and growth stocks (with low book-to-market ratios). A positive HML value implies that value stocks have outperformed growth stocks. In the regression, this factor is represented by the `Beta_HML` coefficient, which measures the stock's exposure to the value factor.
    

The regression's dependent variable is the excess return of the stock over the risk-free rate (RI-RF). The goal of the regression is to determine how much of the stock's excess return can be explained by these three factors. The regression's intercept, `Alpha`, represents the average excess return of the stock that cannot be explained by the three factors. A positive Alpha implies that the stock has generated returns above what would be expected given its exposure to the three factors, indicating good stock or portfolio management.

In summary, the regression using the Fama-French three-factor model helps to evaluate a stock or portfolio's performance by decomposing its excess returns into components attributable to the market, size, and value factors, as well as the stock-specific Alpha. This analysis can be useful for understanding the stock's risk exposure and evaluating the effectiveness of investment strategies.

four different plots to visualize the financial data. Each plot serves a different purpose and provides insights into the data.

1.  Factor Returns Over Time: This plot displays the returns of the three Fama-French factors (Mkt-RF, SMB, and HML) over time. It helps to visualize the performance of these factors and understand their trends during the specified period.
    
2.  Momentum Returns Over Time: This plot shows the momentum returns (RI) of the stock over time. It provides a visual representation of the stock's monthly returns and helps to identify periods of strong or weak performance.
    
3.  Historical Stock Returns Over Time: This plot displays the historical stock returns (RI) over time. It helps to visualize the stock's performance and understand its historical trends.
    
4.  Fitted vs. Actual Stock Returns: This scatter plot compares the fitted returns (predicted by the Fama-French three-factor model) to the actual excess returns (RI-RF) of the stock. This plot can be used to assess the model's accuracy in explaining the stock's returns. A strong correlation between the fitted and actual returns would indicate that the model is effective in capturing the stock's performance.
    

These plots together provide a comprehensive view of the stock's performance, its exposure to different risk factors, and the effectiveness of the Fama-French three-factor model in explaining the stock's returns.
